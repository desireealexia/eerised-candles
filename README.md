## Design

### Colour Scheme

EERISED Candles uses a minimal, bold colour palette:

- Black (#000000): Base colour used for depth and contrast
- White (#FFFFFF): Clean, neutral background and text
- Mustard (#F7CF48): Accent colour inspired by candlelight

This scheme reflects the brand’s warm, modern, and minimal aesthetic.

### Typography

The site uses the **Lato** typeface throughout. It’s clean, modern, and easy to read — aligning with the brand’s minimal aesthetic.

### Imagery

Imagery is warm and moody, focusing on candlelight, shadows, and natural textures. Photos are styled to reflect calm, comfort, and intentional living.

### Wireframes

The layout and structure of this website are based on the walkthrough project provided in the Code Institute's Level 5 Diploma in Web Application Development course - specifically, the "Project - Boutique Ado." Since the design was already established, I did not create separate wireframes for this project.

## Code Validation

### HTML Validator

To ensure the correctness of the HTML code, I used the W3C HTML Validator. The validation process revealed no errors in the HTML code across all pages of the website. This confirms that the HTML is properly structured and adheres to web standards.

### CSS Validator

For CSS validation, I utilised the W3C CSS Validator. The CSS code was thoroughly checked, and no errors were found. This indicates that the CSS is correctly formatted and conforms to the established CSS standards.

## Bugs

### Update Button Not Submitting Form

The update buttons on the shopping bag page were not working due to a bug in the JavaScript that relied on the DOM structure to locate and submit the correct form. Specifically, it used `.closest('.row')` to find the associated `.update-form`, but after changes to the HTML layout, the form was no longer within the same `.row`, resulting in `form.submit()` not being triggered. This prevented users from updating item quantities in their bag. To fix the issue, the code was refactored to use a `data-target` attribute on each update button, pointing to the `id` of the corresponding form. The click handler then uses this attribute to directly select and submit the form, removing any dependency on the surrounding HTML structure. As a result, the update functionality now works reliably across all screen sizes and layouts.

### Update and Remove Buttons Not Aligned Horizontally on Larger Screens

The bug involved the "Update" and "Remove" buttons not staying aligned horizontally on larger screens. They were placed inside a container with Bootstrap grid classes (`col-12 col-sm-6`), but this setup caused them to stack vertically rather than appearing side by side. This misalignment affected the layout by creating an inconsistent user interface, potentially confusing users about the relationship between the buttons and the associated item. To fix the issue, the buttons were wrapped in a `div` with responsive grid classes (`col-12 col-sm-6 col-md-12 col-lg-12`) and utility classes (`d-flex justify-content-between`) to enforce a horizontal layout using Flexbox. Additionally, `float-right` was applied to the `.remove-item` class to ensure it aligned correctly within the container. As a result, the buttons now display side by side across all screen sizes, resolving the layout issue and improving the overall user experience.

### Update Button in Shopping Bag Not Working

There was a bug where clicking the "Update" link in the shopping bag did not adjust the product quantity as expected. This was because the link's default behavior—navigating to a new page—was preventing the form from submitting properly. As a result, users were unable to update item quantities in their cart, which could lead to frustration and abandoned purchases. To fix the issue, `e.preventDefault()`; was added to the JavaScript click event handler for the "Update" link. This prevented the default link behavior and allowed the form to submit correctly. After applying the fix, the issue was resolved and users can now successfully update item quantities in their shopping bag.

#### Bugs Not Fixed

- **Bag Table Layout Shift on Multiple Items:** When two or more items are added to the shopping bag, the table layout on the bag page shifts unexpectedly. The exact cause of this issue is currently unknown. As it does not affect core functionality or user ability to complete a purchase, it has been left unfixed for now.
